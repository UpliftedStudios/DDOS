      "title": "Lift Your Eyes",
      "scripture": "And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him: \"Lift your eyes now and look from the place where you are—northward, southward, eastward, and westward; for all the land which you see I give to you and your descendants forever.\"\n (Genesis 13:14,15)",
      "body": "There are things the Lord cannot and will not show you until He gets you alone. The Bible is filled with stories of men and women God sets apart to Himself -- in fact, those men and women are the only ones He can truly and fully use. If we will not leave the comforts of home, riches, pedigree, human wisdom, or popularity we cannot be fully used of God, and our spiritual world-view remains limited, at best. Come away with God, then, lift your eyes. \n\nIt is rare that God will use a man who is accepted and highly thought of by the world. It is also rare that He will use an exceptional man or one who is sufficient in himself. Rather, He looks for one who is simple and humble enough to believe. The world (and many in the church) will see that man as a strange choice, but the Lord sees the one who is not afraid to stand on His promises — and that faithful one must be willing to stand apart and stand alone. It may take some time for God to get a man off to Himself, but in His mind, the wait is worth it. That is the man He can speak to, and when He speaks, \"He will say, Lift your eyes . . .",
      "prayer": "Father, thank You for showing us things as You see them. We lift our eyes today, and we see all creation poised to give You praise and glory. In Jesus, Amen."

      "title": "Do Not Marvel",
      "scripture": "\"Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’\"\n(John 3:7)",
      "body": "Never dispute with a man or woman who says they cannot help the condition they are in, because they were born that way. They were born that way, and so were you. When Adam fell, sin rushed in and infected us to the core, right down to our very DNA; and we became transgressors, rebels, and enemies of God by nature — human nature defiled by sin. All of us are natural-born sinners. We are liars, cheaters, selfish, hateful, prideful, and the list goes on and on. This is not easy to hear, but it is true. Only after acknowledging the awful truth about myself and others can I begin to understand the Lord's words, \"You must be born again.\"\n\nJesus gave His life to tear down the partition sin erected between us and God. If any man or woman desires to know and be known by God, he or she must come to Him on the terms of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. No service we render or goodness we possess can earn us a place in the family of God, but we are related to Him on this one condition — \"You must be born again.\" That is the central truth of the New Testament; that Jesus gave His life for us, and we must believe in Him in order to receive everlasting life. That is God's condition, and that condition is His Son. There will never be another way, another truth, or another life. Jesus is all, and Jesus is enough.",
      "prayer": "Dear Lord, I am a sinner, a wretched man, a rebel, and a cheat. Yet, You loved me in the midst of my sin and saved my soul by giving Your Son's life for mine. I will never cease believing, praising, thanking, and serving You. Amen."

      "title": "God Never Forgets",
      "scripture": "Then Abram said, “Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born in my house is my heir!”\n(Genesis 15:3)",
      "body": "We will all experience difficult moments when it seems God forgot His promise or the time of fulfillment has expired; but He is simply developing patience in us and purifying our faith. He is also preparing us to be a greater blessing than we can imagine, as others are being prepared to receive the blessings that will come through us. Even today, believers are walking in the faith and blessings of Abraham, because he believed God. In the same way, may generations that follow us be able to walk in the blessings of our faith -- if we believe!\n\nGod's ways are not our ways, and neither is His timing. He has the leisure and knowledge of past, present, and future, and He is the Master of the divine moment. Not even Jesus knows the precise hour of His return, and even He has chosen to wait on His Father, that the Father alone might be our All in All. Abram's faith was rooted in trust, for the things God promised him were not possible, so it seemed. That trust was the fertile ground the Lord would use to do the impossible and make a way where there was none. Isaac was on the way, and Abram would be tested in the interim. He would pass his test, and so must we -- and pass it we will, by faith and faith alone.",
      "prayer": "Father God, I trust You. It’s that simple. Help me in the times when I get impatient and weak. Speak to me, and encourage me, Lord. Thank You for purifying my faith, even though it hurts! Amen."
