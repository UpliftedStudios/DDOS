      "scripture": "And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him: \"Lift your eyes now and look from the place where you are—northward, southward, eastward, and westward; for all the land which you see I give to you and your descendants forever.\"\n (Genesis 13:14,15)",
      "body": "There are things the Lord cannot and will not show you until He gets you alone. The Bible is filled with stories of men and women God sets apart to Himself -- in fact, those men and women are the only ones He can truly and fully use. If we will not leave the comforts of home, riches, pedigree, human wisdom, or popularity we cannot be fully used of God, and our spiritual world-view remains limited, at best. Come away with God, then, lift your eyes. \n\nIt is rare that God will use a man who is accepted and highly thought of by the world. It is also rare that He will use an exceptional man or one who is sufficient in himself. Rather, He looks for one who is simple and humble enough to believe. The world (and many in the church) will see that man as a strange choice, but the Lord sees the one who is not afraid to stand on His promises — and that faithful one must be willing to stand apart and stand alone. It may take some time for God to get a man off to Himself, but in His mind, the wait is worth it. That is the man He can speak to, and when He speaks, \"He will say, Lift your eyes . . .",
      "prayer": "Father, thank You for showing us things as You see them. We lift our eyes today, and we see all creation poised to give You praise and glory. In Jesus, Amen."

      "title": "Do Not Marvel",
      "scripture": "\"Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’\"\n(John 3:7)",
      "body": "Never dispute with a man or woman who says they cannot help the condition they are in, because they were born that way. They were born that way, and so were you. When Adam fell, sin rushed in and infected us to the core, right down to our very DNA; and we became transgressors, rebels, and enemies of God by nature — human nature defiled by sin. All of us are natural-born sinners. We are liars, cheaters, selfish, hateful, prideful, and the list goes on and on. This is not easy to hear, but it is true. Only after acknowledging the awful truth about myself and others can I begin to understand the Lord's words, \"You must be born again.\"\n\nJesus gave His life to tear down the partition sin erected between us and God. If any man or woman desires to know and be known by God, he or she must come to Him on the terms of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. No service we render or goodness we possess can earn us a place in the family of God, but we are related to Him on this one condition — \"You must be born again.\" That is the central truth of the New Testament; that Jesus gave His life for us, and we must believe in Him in order to receive everlasting life. That is God's condition, and that condition is His Son. There will never be another way, another truth, or another life. Jesus is all, and Jesus is enough.",
      "prayer": "Dear Lord, I am a sinner, a wretched man, a rebel, and a cheat. Yet, You loved me in the midst of my sin and saved my soul by giving Your Son's life for mine. I will never cease believing, praising, thanking, and serving You. Amen."

      "scripture": "Then Abram said, “Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born in my house is my heir!”\n(Genesis 15:3)",
      "body": "We will all experience difficult moments when it seems God forgot His promise or the time of fulfillment has expired; but He is simply developing patience in us and purifying our faith. He is also preparing us to be a greater blessing than we can imagine, as others are being prepared to receive the blessings that will come through us. Even today, believers are walking in the faith and blessings of Abraham, because he believed God. In the same way, may generations that follow us be able to walk in the blessings of our faith -- if we believe!\n\nGod's ways are not our ways, and neither is His timing. He has the leisure and knowledge of past, present, and future, and He is the Master of the divine moment. Not even Jesus knows the precise hour of His return, and even He has chosen to wait on His Father, that the Father alone might be our All in All. Abram's faith was rooted in trust, for the things God promised him were not possible, so it seemed. That trust was the fertile ground the Lord would use to do the impossible and make a way where there was none. Isaac was on the way, and Abram would be tested in the interim. He would pass his test, and so must we -- and pass it we will, by faith and faith alone.",
      "prayer": "Father God, I trust You. It’s that simple. Help me in the times when I get impatient and weak. Speak to me, and encourage me, Lord. Thank You for purifying my faith, even though it hurts! Amen."

      "body": "If we will be still and wait on Jesus, He will fight our battles, and no enemy will be too strong for us. We must lay aside our own agenda, get into the posture of prayer and intercession, and let the Lord lead us to victory. When we are fully trusting in Jesus Christ, we will pray, \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\" That is the prayer of a saint who is surrendered to God and positioned for victory.\n\nThere are two types of battles in the Christian life, earthly and heavenly ones. Jesus was only taken up with heaven's issues, and so must it be with us. While there are an endless number of things we could be concerned with, the Lord teaches His children to focus on spiritual things and that which aligns us with Him. Our position for warfare is down on our knees, and no saint has ever lost a single battle from that posture! Remember, our God is a Man of War, and He wins every battle He fights! So position yourself, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord.",
      "prayer": "Lord, I lay down my ways and wisdom, and I take up Your armor, which is Christ. I will humble myself and be still. The battle is the Lord's, and the victory is nigh! In Jesus alone, Amen."

      "scripture": "Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ.\n(1Corinthians 11:1)",
      "body": "The Kingdom of God is not a matter of independence, but interdependence and the willingness to be led. God has been so good to place those before us who will lead us in the way we should go, if only we will follow them; and He holds us responsible for recognizing, honoring, and imitating them as they imitate Christ. So, note and revere the men and women who are over you in the Lord, for that is a pathway of peace.\n\nJust as Jesus was an Example to His disciples, the Kingdom advances when we follow closely behind the leaders God ordains in our day. He has given some to be apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers (Ephesians 4:11), so that His church is equipped, edified, and ushered into spiritual maturity. This leadership is not based on giftedness or superiority, but humility and grace -- and as long as those leaders are following Christ, they are worth following. We can confidently follow after someone like that, and that is how the Kingdom works. Follow the leader.",
      "prayer": "Lord, I will seek, follow, and honor the God-ordained leadership placed before me. Thank You for the men and women who lead me in the righteous path. Amen."

      "title": "Jesus Paid All",
      "scripture": "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world.\n(1 John 2:2)",
      "body": "‘Propitiation’ means ransom or appeasement. We are all sinners, and that makes it impossible for the Lord to receive or relate to us; for the wages of sin is death, and He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Jesus came on this tragic scene as the Lamb of God, who took away our sins by offering up His life in our place. Therefore, the righteous requirement of the law was fulfilled in Him. Those who believe and receive Jesus have eternal life, now that the ransom has been paid and God’s wrath is appeased. Beloveds, the Cross of Christ is the central truth of all that exists in the universe. It is the only thing that truly matters. Do you believe and receive that?\n\nNo one will be able to offer God an acceptable excuse for rejecting or ignoring the Cross. Each one of us has been clearly shown the truth -- that there is a God, He is good, and we need to come to Him on His terms before it is too late. Even the demons know that there is a God in heaven, and they tremble at the thought of His power and their eventual doom. Therefore, the entire world will be judged and held accountable to God's holy standard, and only those of us who have accepted His terms of peace will enter into His rest. His peace and His rest have a name -- Jesus. Be sure to enter in. Today.",
      "prayer": "Dear God, Jesus Christ is the truth, and there is no other. Thank You for revealing Your Son to me. Now, reveal Him through me. Amen."

      "title": "Speak the Truth",
      "scripture": "Therefore, putting away lying, “Let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,” for we are members of one another.\n(Ephesians 4:25)",
      "body": "Godly relationships are built on the firm foundation of truthful speech. We are to speak the truth in love, and by doing so, we love each other as Christ loved us. Jesus always spoke the truth, no matter what the subject, and so must we. When we see our fellow believers as Christ sees them, we will always be sure to let genuine and honest speech flow from our hearts, building one another up in love and truth.\n\nWe will be judged for our words one day, because they affect the lives of those around us. Speaking the truth in every conversation is a firm requirement of the Lord for His children. Our speech makes us faithful or unfaithful witnesses of God's character, therefore, we must make every effort to speak in a way that protects His reputation. Since our words are derived from the condition of our hearts, only hearts that are filled with the Spirit of God are capable of the speech He requires. May the Holy Spirit shed that love abroad in our hearts and through our speech. ",
      "prayer": "Lord, I will carefully guard my speech, especially as it pertains to believers. My conversation will edify my brothers and sisters, and may Your Spirit be pleased with my words at all times. Amen."
