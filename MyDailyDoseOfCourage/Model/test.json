      "body": "There are things the Lord cannot and will not show you until He gets you alone. The Bible is filled with stories of men and women God sets apart to Himself -- in fact, those men and women are the only ones He can truly and fully use. If we will not leave the comforts of home, riches, pedigree, human wisdom, or popularity we cannot be fully used of God, and our spiritual world-view remains limited, at best. Come away with God, then, lift your eyes. \n\nIt is rare that God will use a man who is accepted and highly thought of by the world. It is also rare that He will use an exceptional man or one who is sufficient in himself. Rather, He looks for one who is simple and humble enough to believe. The world (and many in the church) will see that man as a strange choice, but the Lord sees the one who is not afraid to stand on His promises — and that faithful one must be willing to stand apart and stand alone. It may take some time for God to get a man off to Himself, but in His mind, the wait is worth it. That is the man He can speak to, and when He speaks, \"He will say, Lift your eyes . . .",
      "prayer": "Father, thank You for showing us things as You see them. We lift our eyes today, and we see all creation poised to give You praise and glory. In Jesus, Amen."

      "body": "Never dispute with a man or woman who says they cannot help the condition they are in, because they were born that way. They were born that way, and so were you. When Adam fell, sin rushed in and infected us to the core, right down to our very DNA; and we became transgressors, rebels, and enemies of God by nature — human nature defiled by sin. All of us are natural-born sinners. We are liars, cheaters, selfish, hateful, prideful, and the list goes on and on. This is not easy to hear, but it is true. Only after acknowledging the awful truth about myself and others can I begin to understand the Lord's words, \"You must be born again.\"\n\nJesus gave His life to tear down the partition sin erected between us and God. If any man or woman desires to know and be known by God, he or she must come to Him on the terms of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. No service we render or goodness we possess can earn us a place in the family of God, but we are related to Him on this one condition — \"You must be born again.\" That is the central truth of the New Testament; that Jesus gave His life for us, and we must believe in Him in order to receive everlasting life. That is God's condition, and that condition is His Son. There will never be another way, another truth, or another life. Jesus is all, and Jesus is enough.",
      "prayer": "Dear Lord, I am a sinner, a wretched man, a rebel, and a cheat. Yet, You loved me in the midst of my sin and saved my soul by giving Your Son's life for mine. I will never cease believing, praising, thanking, and serving You. Amen."

      "body": "We will all experience difficult moments when it seems God forgot His promise or the time of fulfillment has expired; but He is simply developing patience in us and purifying our faith. He is also preparing us to be a greater blessing than we can imagine, as others are being prepared to receive the blessings that will come through us. Even today, believers are walking in the faith and blessings of Abraham, because he believed God. In the same way, may generations that follow us be able to walk in the blessings of our faith -- if we believe!\n\nGod's ways are not our ways, and neither is His timing. He has the leisure and knowledge of past, present, and future, and He is the Master of the divine moment. Not even Jesus knows the precise hour of His return, and even He has chosen to wait on His Father, that the Father alone might be our All in All. Abram's faith was rooted in trust, for the things God promised him were not possible, so it seemed. That trust was the fertile ground the Lord would use to do the impossible and make a way where there was none. Isaac was on the way, and Abram would be tested in the interim. He would pass his test, and so must we -- and pass it we will, by faith and faith alone.",
      "prayer": "Father God, I trust You. It’s that simple. Help me in the times when I get impatient and weak. Speak to me, and encourage me, Lord. Thank You for purifying my faith, even though it hurts! Amen."

      "body": "If we will be still and wait on Jesus, He will fight our battles, and no enemy will be too strong for us. We must lay aside our own agenda, get into the posture of prayer and intercession, and let the Lord lead us to victory. When we are fully trusting in Jesus Christ, we will pray, \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\" That is the prayer of a saint who is surrendered to God and positioned for victory.\n\nThere are two types of battles in the Christian life, earthly and heavenly ones. Jesus was only taken up with heaven's issues, and so must it be with us. While there are an endless number of things we could be concerned with, the Lord teaches His children to focus on spiritual things and that which aligns us with Him. Our position for warfare is down on our knees, and no saint has ever lost a single battle from that posture! Remember, our God is a Man of War, and He wins every battle He fights! So position yourself, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord.",

      "body": "The Kingdom of God is not a matter of independence, but interdependence and the willingness to be led. God has been so good to place those before us who will lead us in the way we should go, if only we will follow them; and He holds us responsible for recognizing, honoring, and imitating them as they imitate Christ. So, note and revere the men and women who are over you in the Lord, for that is a pathway of peace.\n\nJust as Jesus was an Example to His disciples, the Kingdom advances when we follow closely behind the leaders God ordains in our day. He has given some to be apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers (Ephesians 4:11), so that His church is equipped, edified, and ushered into spiritual maturity. This leadership is not based on giftedness or superiority, but humility and grace -- and as long as those leaders are following Christ, they are worth following. We can confidently follow after someone like that, and that is how the Kingdom works. Follow the leader.",
      "prayer": "Lord, I will seek, follow, and honor the God-ordained leadership placed before me. Thank You for the men and women who lead me in the righteous path. Amen."

      "image": "waterfall",
      "scripture": "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world.\n(1 John 2:2)",
      "body": "‘Propitiation’ means ransom or appeasement. We are all sinners, and that makes it impossible for the Lord to receive or relate to us; for the wages of sin is death, and He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Jesus came on this tragic scene as the Lamb of God, who took away our sins by offering up His life in our place. Therefore, the righteous requirement of the law was fulfilled in Him. Those who believe and receive Jesus have eternal life, now that the ransom has been paid and God’s wrath is appeased. Beloveds, the Cross of Christ is the central truth of all that exists in the universe. It is the only thing that truly matters. Do you believe and receive that?\n\nNo one will be able to offer God an acceptable excuse for rejecting or ignoring the Cross. Each one of us has been clearly shown the truth -- that there is a God, He is good, and we need to come to Him on His terms before it is too late. Even the demons know that there is a God in heaven, and they tremble at the thought of His power and their eventual doom. Therefore, the entire world will be judged and held accountable to God's holy standard, and only those of us who have accepted His terms of peace will enter into His rest. His peace and His rest have a name -- Jesus. Be sure to enter in. Today.",

      "body": "Godly relationships are built on the firm foundation of truthful speech. We are to speak the truth in love, and by doing so, we love each other as Christ loved us. Jesus always spoke the truth, no matter what the subject, and so must we. When we see our fellow believers as Christ sees them, we will always be sure to let genuine and honest speech flow from our hearts, building one another up in love and truth.\n\nWe will be judged for our words one day, because they affect the lives of those around us. Speaking the truth in every conversation is a firm requirement of the Lord for His children. Our speech makes us faithful or unfaithful witnesses of God's character, therefore, we must make every effort to speak in a way that protects His reputation. Since our words are derived from the condition of our hearts, only hearts that are filled with the Spirit of God are capable of the speech He requires. May the Holy Spirit shed that love abroad in our hearts and through our speech. ",

      "scripture": "Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.”\n(Exodus 3:5)",
      "body": "A casual relationship with the Lord is no relationship at all. All who draw near to Him must regard Him as holy and purify themselves, just as He is pure. God requires a clean vessel for the in-filling of the Holy Spirit, and we are unwise to think He is content to overlook the undone areas in our character. The Lord is holy, and He will have nothing to do with sin and unrepentant sinners. It is wise to come to grips with that truth as the Day approaches.\n\nWe must not get familiar with God. Moses had much to learn, and His first lesson was God is not like him, and His ways and thoughts are higher than his. Most importantly, He is not to be approached with a presumptuous attitude -- but the closer we come to God, the more reverence and awe we must give. He is not our buddy, but our Friend -- and we are only His friends if we obey His commands. Therefore, we must be attentive and careful as we walk before the Lord -- walking in a way that advances the Kingdom through our witness and our worship. All glory to God and no one else. Seek to draw near, and when you do, take off those shoes!",
      "prayer": "Father, forgive me for a casual and familiar attitude when I come into Your presence. It is an unfathomable honor to be called and chosen to come before You, and may I value and seek those times more and more. In Jesus’ name, Amen."

      "body": "God will show us the things that hinder our fellowship with Him, and one great hindrance is the failure to be reconciled with others. It is impossible to be right with the Lord and wrong with your brother or sister. When the Holy Spirit instructs you to reconcile with another, do it, and do it right away. Go to your brother today and make things right. There can be no spiritual progress until you do.\n\nIt is important to be in right standing with every believer, and we must endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace. God desires relationships that are holy and healthy, and He expects us to diligently pursue that end. His instruction to \"be reconciled\" is not optional, and our offering (or ministry) is not acceptable until that instruction is followed. Jesus means every word He says -- so, \"Go your way . . . be reconciled.\"",
      "prayer": "Precious Lord, I desire to have unbroken fellowship with You, and I realize that requires holy relationships with those around me. Reveal anything that hinders, and I will tend to that thing today. In Jesus’ name, Amen. "

      "body": "My Bible teaches we are made by God and for God, and we find our true purpose in life when we acknowledge Him as our Creator and the Author and Finisher of our faith. His love for us is deeper and wider than we can imagine, and that shows in the intricate care with which we were all made. He designed us and gave us life -- and He has set Himself to save us, care for us, and spend eternity with us. We can trust Him to be attentive to every detail and aspect of our lives, and that is what it means to be the redeemed of the Lord. So, let's be sure to come humbly to the One who made us, loves us, and always has our best interests at heart.\n\nThere is no \"Mother Earth,\" but only \"Father God.\" Like us, the worlds were made by God, yet only we are made in His image (likeness). The Lord did not randomly produce humanity, and we are not some accident or afterthought of nature left to our own devices; and while the heavens and the earth will one day be done away with, we will dwell with our Lord forever in a new heaven and a new earth which comes down from above. This is the revelation David is sharing with us here, and we do well to think more often and deeply on these things, and to give praise to God for His wonderful and everlasting love.",
      "prayer": "Father, I come to You, asking that You heal and repair every defect in my character, as I truly want to be like my Savior, Jesus Christ.

      "body": "The word we preach is the power to convey the Man, Jesus Christ, to the desperately needy world all around us. The work is difficult and arduous, and the preacher should count the cost before he preaches. This ministry requires consistent effort and care, and there is much stubbornness and sin to overcome. Yet, there is great power in the Word we preach -- not our preaching alone, but the Word.  If we mix God's word with human wisdom, we will fall far short of our calling, and more people will be hindered than helped. When the focus is kept on the Word, our preaching will populate heaven and empty hell! So preach God's Word, and God's Word only.\n\nThe Word of God is the only thing of value preachers have to offer. Even the best preaching will fail to accomplish anything spiritual unless it is settled firmly on the Scriptures. Hearing us preach, are the listeners left with an impression of us or God? That is always the question. When we speak, men and women should walk away satisfied, having been served hot bread from the ovens of heaven. May the Lord be revealed and glorified in our preaching every time.",

Wisdom is the precious inheritance stored up for us by our Father, and we are wise to seek a double portion. It is the Lord's desire that the pursuit of wisdom be our priority, and by it, we become more acquainted with Him and His ways. When we take hold of spiritual wisdom and understanding, we are blessed in all we do, and we are a blessing to everyone around us. That is God's will for His children -- for you.\n\nEach of us will make decisions about who and what we follow, and there are many voices which claim to know the way we ought to go. The world is filled with experts, advice, motivation, and methodology. Yet, only God's Word is eternal truth, spirit, and life. His words give us wisdom to live by, and when we receive them, we will enjoy abundant life according to those words. There is wisdom stored up for us in the scriptures, and that is where we are sure to find peace and prosperity. Therefore, get God's wisdom, for it leads to life -- eternal life.",

You and I are in desperate need of the wisdom and knowledge we can only receive from Him. His wisdom produces a firm grasp of the reality, of things seen and unseen, how those things relate, and how we should operate in their midst. The mysteries of the universe are revealed in the wisdom of our God, as well as His provision for our daily needs! Just ask.\n\nGod is not disappointed when we continually come to Him for wisdom. He never says, \"You again?\" In fact, He is pleased to see us waiting at His gates and longing to receive His counsel. His wisdom is given to us without charge, because no one possesses enough riches to purchase a single word He speaks. He encourages us to come and buy without money or price. A clean heart and an open mind are all He requires. Therefore, no believer should ever lack wisdom. James says, we don't have, because we don't ask (James 4:2). Let that not be said of you. \"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.\" (Matthew 7:7)",

Some works can be accomplished by the sheer force of human effort, sincerity, good will, philanthropy, and charity. Yet, there is power which comes down from heaven in the Person of the Holy Spirit, and by that power, believers do works that glorify God and accomplish things according to His will and purpose. The choice is ours — working in our own power, or God working through us by His Spirit. Let us choose wisely.\n\nThe works of God are done in the power of the Spirit. Therefore, all things are possible, as we see in the wonderful ministry of our Lord:\n\n• Jesus feeds 5,000 with two fish and five loaves of bread.\n\n• Jesus turns water into wine.\n\n• Jesus gives sight to the blind.\n\n• Jesus casts out demons and sickness.\n\n• Jesus raises the dead.\n\n• Jesus forgives and restores sinners.\n\nHaving done these things and much more, Jesus tells His disciples that we will do even greater works (John 14:12)! How is that possible? It is only possible when we are filled with the Holy Spirit who descended and remained upon Jesus, just as He wishes to fill and remain in us. So, be filled with the Spirit, and let Him have His way. Good works will surely follow.",
